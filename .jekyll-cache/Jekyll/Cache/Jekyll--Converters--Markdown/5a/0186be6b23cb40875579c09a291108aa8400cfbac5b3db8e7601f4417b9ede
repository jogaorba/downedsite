I"Ù<p>Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, University of Texas at Austin. My work combines cultural studies and digital methodologies in the study of 19th-century abolitionist and racial discourses of Cuban, Puerto Rican and Brazilian immigrant newspapers. My research is funded by the Andrew Mellon Foundation Grant-in-Aid program of the University of Houston <a href="https://artepublicopress.com/digital-humanities">U.S. Latino Digital Humanities (USLDH) program</a>.</p>

<p>My research is informed by my work as a cultural heritage profession in institutions that include the <a href="https://ladi-prod.lib.utexas.edu/en/home">Latin American Digital Initiatives</a> at the LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections, the Puerto Rico Architectural Heritage Archive, and the Library of Congress.</p>

My work was focused on <a href="https://www.neh.gov/blog/title-essays-linked-data-and-ethnic-press-chronicling-america">digital remediation of editors of color</a> in the Chronicling America Collection.
