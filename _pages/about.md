I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, University of Texas at Austin. My work combines cultural studies and digital methodologies in the study of 19th-century abolitionist and racial discourses of Cuban, Puerto Rican and Brazilian immigrant newspapers. My research is funded by the Andrew Mellon Foundation Grant-in-Aid program of the University of Houston [U.S. Latino Digital Humanities (USLDH) program](https://artepublicopress.com/digital-humanities). 

My research is informed by my work as a cultural heritage profession in institutions that include the [Latin American Digital Initiatives](https://ladi-prod.lib.utexas.edu/en/home) at the LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections, the Puerto Rico Architectural Heritage Archive, and the Library of Congress. 

During the summer of 2020, I was the Pathways Program intern for the Division of Preservation and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities. My work was focused on [digital remediation of editors of color](https://www.neh.gov/blog/title-essays-linked-data-and-ethnic-press-chronicling-america) in the Chronicling America Collection. In the summer of 2021, I was <br> a junior fellow for the [Connecting Communities Digital Initiatives](https://www.loc.gov/programs/of-the-people/represent/connecting-communities-digital-initiative/?loclr=blogotp) as part of <br> the Library of Congress Junior Fellow Program.
